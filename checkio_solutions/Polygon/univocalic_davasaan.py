# You have to write a function nameddavasaan(division with all vowels a)    which calculates integer division by 10.
# The vowels "eiou" are disallowed as are the slash "/",    asterisk "*", and period "." characters.
# 
# We have one more rule for thisunivocalicchallenge.    This is a code golf mission and your main goal is to make your code as short as possible:300 charactersis the maximum allowable.    The shorter your code, the more remarkable you are.
# Note that your code can start/end with empty lines and commented lines,    they are not considered for code length.    Hence you can comment a bit your code.
# 
# Input:A non-negative number as an integer.
# 
# Output:The integer division (//10) of the input as an integer.
# 
# Precondition:0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2,000,000,000
