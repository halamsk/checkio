# Two teams of robots are playing the game ofcut-or-bend. 	The rules of the game are very simple:The team that has processed more details than its opponent is		the winner.A detail is considered to be processed if it is either bent or cut.Each robot can perform both bending and cutting but during the game, 		it can perform only one function.Each team consists of N players, K of them must be occupied with cutting. 		All the rest must be occupied with bending.Suppose you are the coach of one of these teams. You are given two lists 	of positive integers both of size N representing stats of your team. The i-th value 	in the first list is the number of details that can be cut by the i-th member of 	the team during the game. Similarly, the i-th value in the second list is the number 	of details which can be bent by the i-th member of the team during the game. Knowing 	the value of K calculate the maximum score which can be obtained by your team.
# 
# Input:Three arguments. Two lists of integers of equal size representing team's stats. 	An integer - number of team's members that has to be occupied with cutting.
# 
# Output:An integer - maximum score which can be obtained by the team.
# 
# 1 ≤ K ≤ N - 11 ≤ list[i] ≤ 100
